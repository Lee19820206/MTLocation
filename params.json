Currently the library contains a simple Location Manager-Singleton that sends out notifications when CLLocationManager-Delegate-Methods are called and a UIBarButtonItem/UIButton that acts as a Locate-Me Button that behaves similar to the one in the Google Maps App. The switch from one mode to another is animated, just like in the Google Maps App.\r\n\r\nIt can also be customized to support Heading-Updates or not, by setting property headingEnabled.","tagline":"A Framework to add convenience-stuff for easier coping with CoreLocation/MapKit on iOS.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
